Description: Maven Common Artifact Filters
 Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the
 concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build,
 reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
 .
 Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete
 state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to
 attain this goal there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts
 to deal with:
 .
    * Making the build process easy
    * Providing a uniform build system
    * Providing quality project information
    * Providing guidelines for best practices development
    * Allowing transparent migration to new features
 .
 This package ships a shared library containing a collection of ready-made
 filters to control inclusion/exclusion of artifacts during dependency
 resolution.
